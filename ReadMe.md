## Technical Contribution
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Titanic dataset using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to understand data distribution and identify missing values.
- Handled missing data with **imputation techniques** and feature engineering to improve model quality.
- Applied multiple **machine learning algorithms** including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost** for survival prediction.
- Implemented **cross-validation** (K-Fold & Stratified K-Fold) to ensure robust model evaluation.
- Optimized model performance using **hyperparameter tuning** and **SMOTE oversampling** to handle class imbalance.
- Built a **predictive pipeline** for automated data preprocessing and model prediction, ensuring reproducibility.

## Business Contribution
- Provided insights into **factors affecting passenger survival**, helping to understand historical patterns.
- Created a **predictive model** that estimates survival probability, which can be adapted for risk assessment in transportation safety studies.
- Demonstrated the value of **data-driven decision making** using publicly available datasets, enabling educational and research use.
- Streamlined data analysis workflow, saving time for analysts and making it easier to explore new datasets.
